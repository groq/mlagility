# MlAgility Installation Guide

The following describes how to install MlAgility.

## Installing mlagility locally

Install the `mlagility` package into your environment simply run

```
pip install -e .
```

inside the mlagility repository.

> _Note_: If you are planning to use `mlagility` with Groq or Slurm please see the corresponding sections below.

## Installing Groq support

When you install `pip install` `mlagility`, `pip` will also install the `groqflow` `pip` package for you. 

However, if you want to use mlagility with your Groq SDK and GroqChip processor hardware you must also follow the steps in the [GroqFlow Install Guide](https://github.com/groq/groqflow/blob/release/0921/docs/install.md), particularly:
1. [Prerequisites](https://github.com/groq/groqflow/blob/release/0921/docs/install.md#prerequisites): install the GroqWareâ„¢ Suite.
1. [Add GroqWare Suite to Python Path](https://github.com/groq/groqflow/blob/release/0921/docs/install.md#step-3-add-groqware-suite-to-python-path)

## Installing Slurm support

Slurm is an open source workload manager for clusters. If you would like to use slurm to build multiple models simultaneously, please follow the instructions below. 

### Install miniconda

```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

### Setup your Slurm environment

Go to the mlagility folder, run the following command and wait for the Slurm job to finish:

```
sbatch src/mlagility/cli/setup_venv.sh
```

### Get an API token from Huggingface.co (optional)

Some models from Huggingface.co might require the use of an API token. You can find your api token under Settings from your Hugging Face account.

To allow slurm to use your api token, simply export your token as an environment variable as shown below:


```
export HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

### Test it

Go to the mlagility folder and build multiple models simultaneously using Slurm.

```
benchit benchmark --all -s models/selftest/ --use-slurm --build-only --cache-dir PATH_TO_A_CACHE_DIR
```
