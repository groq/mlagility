# MLAgility Tool Examples

This directory contains examples to help you learn how to use the MLAgility tools. The examples are split up into two sub-directories:
1. `examples/cli`: a tutorial series for the `benchit` CLI. This is the recommended starting point.
1. `examples/api`: scripts that demonstrate how to use the `benchmark_model()` and (coming soon) `benchmark_script()` APIs.
