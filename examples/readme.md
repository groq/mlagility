# MLAgility Tool Examples

This directory contains examples to help you learn how to use the MLAgility tools. The examples are split up into two sub-directories:
1. `examples/cli`: a tutorial series for the `benchit` CLI. This is the recommended starting point.
1. `examples/model_api`: scripts that demonstrate how to use the `mlagility.benchmark_model()` API.
1. `examples/onnxflow`: scripts that demonstrate how to use the `onnxflow.buildit()` API.
