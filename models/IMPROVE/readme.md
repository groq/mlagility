# Readme

To run IMPROVE libraries download the [IMPROVE](https://github.com/JDACS4C-IMPROVE/IMPROVE) repo and add it to PYTHONPATH.
You must also `export IMPROVE_DATA_DIR=/tmp/` or any directory of your choice.
Then repeat this for the model you want to run, 

i.e.
`git clone https://github.com/JDACS4C-IMPROVE/GraphDRP/tree/develop`
and add it to your PYTHONPATH
